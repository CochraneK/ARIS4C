# ARIS4C 000 · Decision Log

## 2026-09-19 · Git-resident 000 controller

**Decision:** Create a dedicated Git-resident 000 command-center handoff.

**Why:** The chat named 000 is the human-facing portfolio controller, but cross-account/computer/agent continuity cannot rely on that chat being available. A new executor needs one obvious repository entry point before selecting a numbered paper.

**Boundary:** 000 summarizes portfolio state and scheduling. It does not duplicate or override paper-level scientific truth.

## 2026-09-19 · Four-state live execution taxonomy

**Decision:** Use Finish / Active / Wait / Block as the only primary portfolio execution states.

**Why:** The controller needs to distinguish completed work, genuinely moving work, executable-but-idle work, and externally blocked work.

## 2026-09-19 · Completion-first scheduling

**Decision:** In the absence of an explicit user override, continue genuine Active work first, then select the highest-progress Wait paper.

**Why:** The portfolio should convert near-complete work into finished outputs rather than spreading effort thinly across all executable projects.

## 2026-09-19 · Checkpoint before paper switch

**Decision:** A bounded substantive unit must be committed and its handoff synchronized before 000 intentionally switches to another paper.

**Why:** Git, not chat context, is the recoverable source of truth.


## 2026-09-19 · Research Command Center split-view UI

**Decision:** Keep two distinct public portfolio presentations.

- `All projects` uses the rolling horizontal research marquee/showcase.
- `Finish / Active / Wait / Block` use the detailed project-card panel.
- Non-empty search results use the detailed card panel.
- The top portfolio Hero/overview is shown only on `All projects`.

**Public card action rule:** expose exactly two paper actions: **English** and **中文**. Prefer PDF targets when available. Do not expose Figures, Tables, Pipeline, Source, or output-readiness badges on project cards.

**Why:** The top-level view is for portfolio discovery and visual scanning; status subviews are operational work surfaces and need denser evidence/gate/blocker detail.


## 2026-09-19 · Adaptive capability-aware Active WIP

**Decision:** Remove the fixed three-paper Active ceiling. Keep 1 as the default WIP and 3 only as a conservative soft reference for ordinary single-controller execution.

**Why:** The useful degree of parallelism depends on the execution environment. Stronger future models, multi-agent orchestration, parallel compute, or better tooling may be able to advance more than three papers simultaneously without sacrificing scientific quality or continuity.

**Guardrail:** Additional Active papers are justified only when they are genuinely moving and paper-level context isolation, bounded Git checkpointing, supervision, and truthful live-state tracking remain intact. If those degrade, WIP should contract rather than preserve a target count.


## 2026-09-19 · Public command center shows in-progress work only

**Decision:** The public Research Command Center displays only projects with `0 < progress < 100`.

- `progress == 0`: hidden because no substantive work has started.
- `progress == 100`: hidden because the current output contract is complete.
- Canonical Git state remains unchanged; hidden projects stay in `papers/dashboard.json` and remain available to scheduling, audit, provenance, and historical reconstruction.
- Public cards, rolling showcase, counts, and today's progress chart follow the same visibility rule.

**Why:** The command center should foreground work that has actually started and still needs advancement, rather than mixing untouched ideas or already-completed outputs into the live execution surface.

## 2026-09-19 · Correction — curve filtering is local, not global

**Supersedes:** “Public command center shows in-progress work only.”

**Decision:** Keep the public Research Command Center as a **complete portfolio surface**. Finish, 0%-progress, and unchanged-today projects remain visible in normal navigation, counts, detailed cards, search, and the All-projects rolling showcase.

Only the **Today's progress time curve** is filtered:

- hide projects whose current activity is `Finish`;
- hide projects whose progress percentage did not change across today's Git-derived checkpoints;
- show non-Finish projects only when at least two checkpoints establish a real percentage change today.

**Why:** The user's intent was to reduce visual noise in the time-series chart, not to remove completed or untouched projects from the rest of the portfolio UI.

## 2026-09-19 · Compress long inactive gaps on the daily progress axis

**Decision:** Today's progress curve uses a disclosed discontinuous time axis.

- Normal checkpoint intervals retain proportional real-time spacing.
- A gap is treated as idle only when it is clearly longer than the day's normal Git-checkpoint rhythm; the threshold is adaptive, bounded between roughly 25 and 60 minutes.
- Long idle gaps are compressed to a small bounded horizontal span.
- Every compressed gap remains visible via a dashed break line, `//` marker, real idle-duration label, and tooltip with the real start/end times.
- Progress percentages, chronological order, and real timestamps are never changed.

**Why:** Multi-hour periods when the user is away from the computer should not dominate the chart as long flat lines, while the visualization must still disclose that real elapsed time was compressed.

## 2026-09-19 · Adaptive percentage window on today's progress chart

**Decision:** The daily progress chart no longer reserves the full 0–100% vertical range when most of it is unused.

- Compute the minimum and maximum progress actually plotted today.
- Add proportional padding and round the visible bounds to 5-point boundaries.
- Preserve a minimum visible vertical span of 20 percentage points to avoid visually exaggerating tiny changes.
- If the visible range omits 0% or 100%, disclose the truncation with axis-break marks and a summary such as `Y 55–85%`.
- Underlying progress values are never transformed.

## 2026-09-21 · "Today" follows the Beijing calendar, not the last dashboard commit

**Decision:** The public daily progress curve is keyed to `Asia/Shanghai` calendar days.

- The displayed day is the current Beijing date even when no dashboard commit occurred that day.
- The page is rebuilt automatically shortly after Beijing midnight via GitHub Actions.
- If progress changes for the first time today, the previous day's last dashboard state is carried forward to 00:00 as a baseline so the first same-day movement is detectable.
- If nothing changes today, the chart correctly shows no changed-today projects rather than continuing to display yesterday's curve.
- CI fails if the generated Today payload is stale or lacks the explicit `Asia/Shanghai` timezone.

## 2026-09-21 · Retiring-chat continuity and homepage visual rules

**Decision:** Treat Git as sufficient recovery state before deleting the 000 chat. Add a dated pre-delete checkpoint and make it part of the 000 cold-start path.

**Decision:** Keep the homepage hero as a two-column desktop component: portfolio summary on the left, today's progress chart on the right; stack responsively on narrow screens.

**Decision:** Finish-paper portfolio previews reuse the original one-page visual itself at compact size with lazy loading. Do not maintain a separately redesigned thumbnail unless a future accessibility requirement justifies it.

**Decision:** The daily progress chart remains a same-day, multi-paper operational view with the existing noise-reduction rules (Finish hidden from the curve only, unchanged-today hidden, idle-gap compression and disclosed adaptive Y window). Static HTML must contain a real summary rather than a loading-only placeholder, and JS/CSS references must be cache-busted.

**Why:** The retiring chat must not be a hidden dependency. Public visuals should remain compact without creating parallel visual truth or stale browser-state failure modes.
