## Canonical research identity

**The Hidden Burden of Bad Science: Estimating the Global Scale and Downstream Cost of Research Integrity Failures**

Scope remains frozen. The 10,000-work confirmatory audit, all 90 AI input batches, batch-output integrity gates, latent prevalence model, correlated-error sensitivity, AI calibration design/candidate/reference-review infrastructure, RLY framework, Innovation Delay scaffold, and SB0/SB1 delayed-recognition infrastructure are complete. The prevalence-critical dependency is now actual AI adjudication labels plus actual reference-review/calibration labels, not further sampling or ontology design.

- [x] No-single-score rule frozen.
- [x] Primary binary severe-failure latent target frozen for identifiability.
- [x] Researcher-level self-report prevalence explicitly separated from article-level prevalence.
- [x] Detection/governance bias explicitly treated as part of the observation model.
- [x] Sleeping Beauty permanent-loss count kept exploratory.

## Evidence

- [x] Canonical numeric evidence ledger exists.
- [x] Crossref/OpenAlex denominator anchors recorded.
- [x] VITALITY I contamination cascade recorded.

- [x] Direct narrow-domain time anchors added: 177 team-hours per retrospective publication, 14 manuscript-formatting hours, and a qualified 4–8 h peer-review context range; transportability and overlap limits are explicit.

## Pilot A — live public-data acquisition

- [x] GitHub Actions networked runner operational.
- [x] OpenAlex core article+review universe extracted for 2000–2025.
- [x] OpenAlex denominator is snapshot-dependent: an earlier frozen query returned **137,445,874** works; the latest Pilot A live snapshot on 2026-09-19 returned **137,434,060** under the same target metadata definition. Snapshot drift is retained rather than forced away.
- [x] Annual counts and query provenance committed.
- [x] Latest Retraction Watch snapshot pinned to Git commit `8324ad5ae03519e1f213d417c6cf3e02d7dc5d1f` (older snapshots retained in Git history).
- [x] Snapshot summarized without redistributing raw CSV.
- [x] Latest live Retraction Watch snapshot: **72,621** correction/event rows.
- [x] Latest live snapshot: **63,504** unique resolvable original-paper DOIs.
- [x] Latest live snapshot: **61,041** unique original DOIs had at least one event with nature `Retraction`.
- [x] Row-level vs unique-work counts separated.
- [x] Retraction dates parsed chronologically rather than lexically.
- [x] Current reason labels/renames handled case-insensitively.
- [x] CI smoke gate passes.

**Interpretation:** these are detected/corrected records, not latent prevalence.

- [x] Adjudication protocol frozen.
- [x] Pilot B data contract frozen.
- [x] Adjudication CSV template committed.
- [x] Probability-aware two-phase sampler implemented.
- [x] Sampling uses independent Bernoulli/Poisson random + enrichment components with exact first-order inclusion probability.

- [x] Design-weighted detector calibration diagnostic implemented.
- [x] Kish effective sample size reported.
- [x] Unresolved/indeterminate labels are never silently recoded as negatives.
- [x] Sampling/calibration invariant tests pass in GitHub Actions.

---


## Pilot D — citation exposure / ghost pilot

- [x] Semantic citation-edge ontology frozen.
- [x] Raw citation exposure pilot executed on 25 high-propagation narrow E1-S sources.
- [x] 914 candidate sources resolved; top 25 selected as a deliberate stress-test.
- [x] 7,443 observed incoming citation exposures across selected sources.
- [x] 1,753 exposures occurred after the source retraction date (**23.55%** of observed exposure in this non-representative stress-test).
- [x] 486 post-retraction citation edges sampled for semantic adjudication.
- [x] Citation Ghost Half-Life estimator implemented with right censoring.
- [x] Corrected yearly-series bug; current descriptive pilot: 23 estimable sources, 20 half-life events, 3 right-censored, Kaplan–Meier median 1 year.
- [ ] Dependence Ghost Half-Life pending semantic citation-context adjudication.

**Interpretation:** raw citation exposure decays faster than cumulative exposure disappears. The 1-year median is descriptive for deliberately high-citation sources and is not a global contamination half-life.

## AI adjudication / confirmatory design

- [x] AI adjudication protocol frozen.
- [x] Locked prompt v1 frozen.
- [x] Dual-AI consensus/arbitration merger implemented.
- [x] AI error design scenarios executed.
- [x] Random-audit design simulation executed.
- [x] Confirmatory random sample decision: **5,000 minimum / 10,000 preferred**.
- [x] Scaled full-period random audit executed: **10,000 works** over 2000–2025.
- [x] Dual-AI blinded inputs generated: **20,000 assignments / 80 deterministic batches**.
- [x] Public-safe scaled-audit summary and batch manifest committed.
- [x] External AI adjudication handoff specification written.
- [x] Citation-edge dual-AI packet generated: **486 edges / 972 assignments / 10 batches**.
- [x] Fail-closed batch-output collector implemented for all 80 article + 10 citation batches; checksum/row-count/adjudicator/prompt/vocabulary/abstention invariants enforced.
- [x] Calibrated dual-AI latent prevalence model implemented and six-stratum synthetic recovery passed.
- [x] Correlated-AI-error sensitivity implemented from conditional independence to maximal positive shared-error dependence.
- [x] Calibration anchor design implemented with exact rare-event specificity bounds: at 95% confidence and zero observed false positives, ~299 independent negatives support FPR<1%, ~598 support <0.5%, ~2,995 support <0.1%, ~5,990 support <0.05%, and ~29,956 support <0.01%.
- [x] Private Retraction Watch calibration-candidate builder implemented; row-level candidates are not committed/uploaded.
- [x] Latest candidate queues: **1,435 P_HIGH_REVIEW / 586 P_REVIEW / 5,314 N_PROCESS_REVIEW / 3,026 N_ERROR_REVIEW / 53,143 U_REVIEW**; these are review queues, not truth labels.
- [x] Blinded dual reference-review pipeline implemented: REF_A/REF_B receive neutral bibliography only, never queue labels or AI_A/AI_B outputs.
- [x] Reference merger preserves detailed states (`HONEST_MAJOR_ERROR`, `MINOR_OR_IMMATERIAL`, `NO_MATERIAL_PROBLEM_FOUND`) and only promotes dual-consensus A/B anchors; disagreements/unresolved/C-quality cases stay out of Se/Sp calibration.
- [ ] Run dual-AI article adjudication + arbitration.
- [ ] Run dual-AI citation-edge adjudication + arbitration.
- [ ] Execute REF_A/REF_B primary-evidence reference reviews on calibration candidates, merge dual-consensus anchors, then calibrate AI error using A-only primary / A+B sensitivity sets.

## RLY / human-time burden

- [x] RLY decomposition frozen as RLY-P / RLY-D / RLY-C / RLY-I.
- [x] Fail-closed RLY calculator implemented.
- [x] Empirical total is blocked when attribution, time conversion, or overlap resolution is missing.
- [x] Direct narrow-domain time anchors recorded with non-transportability warnings.
- [x] Participant sacrifice, career spillover, peer-review denominator and financial cost remain separate dimensions unless a valid time-conversion model exists.
- [ ] Calibrate attributable hours per severe-failure unit / material-dependence edge / correction event before any empirical global RLY total.

## Innovation Delay / Scientific Detour

- [x] Innovation Delay protocol and data contract frozen.
- [x] Matched event-study estimator implemented with baseline normalization, pre-trend diagnostics and bootstrap intervals.
- [x] Output-equivalent delay years implemented without relabeling them as literal discovery years.
- [x] Pre-shock OpenAlex semantic-neighborhood candidate builder implemented; post-treatment matching leakage is prohibited.
- [x] Azoulay et al. retraction-spillover study recorded as causal-design precedent.
- [ ] Run real matched topic event studies after adjudicated E1-S source set is available.

## Sleeping Beauty / delayed recognition

- [x] Ke et al. Beauty Coefficient and awakening-time definitions implemented.
- [x] Historical citation trajectories reconstruct full incoming-citation years using live OpenAlex grouped queries; truncated Work `counts_by_year` is explicitly forbidden for mature histories.
- [x] Mature random engineering pilot completed on **200/200** cited article/review works published 1990–2005 and observed through 2025.
- [x] Current main-run SB0 pilot: B median **2.5**, q95 **26.78**, max **85**; peak age median **6 y**; awakening age median **4.5 y**.
- [x] Leakage-safe SB1 landmark dataset implemented and live-tested.
- [x] With landmark age 5 and 10-year horizon, **200/200** pilot papers had mature follow-up; **56** had engineering awakening-after-landmark outcomes and **74** had late-peak outcomes.
- [x] SB1 early-citation baseline implemented with publication-year-blocked out-of-fold validation: **AUC 0.614**, **Brier 0.1973** vs prevalence-baseline **0.2045** (improvement **0.0072**). Interpretation: early citation trajectory carries only modest signal and is not enough for lost-discovery identification.
- [ ] Add temporally frozen semantic/network predictors for SB1.
- [ ] Run SB2 integrity-exposure / awakening-hazard analysis only after E1-S/SCF exposure is empirically available.
- [ ] Keep SB3 suppressed-opportunity / never-awoken counterfactual behind calibration and causal-identification gates.

# Live Pilot A anchors

Primary target denominator:

`OpenAlex core + type:article|review + publication_year:2000-2025`

- latest Pilot A metadata count (2026-09-19 snapshot): **137,434,060**
- source: OpenAlex Works API
- extraction timestamp stored in `data/pilot/openalex_universe_provenance.json`

Retraction Watch snapshot:

- latest event rows: **72,621**
- latest unique original-paper DOIs: **63,504**
- latest unique original DOIs with Retraction nature: **61,041**
- paper-mill signal unique DOIs: **11,706**
- narrow auto E1-S unique DOIs: **2,021**
- strong E1-M unique DOIs: **18,871**
- strong E1-P unique DOIs: **20,429**
- rows/cases requiring manual review remain large; these auto flags are screening variables only.

See `data/pilot/retraction_watch_snapshot_summary.json`.

# Important external calibration anchors

- Xie et al. 2021 pooled researcher-level FFP self-report: 2.9% (95% CI 2.1–3.8%); **not paper prevalence**.
- VITALITY I: retracted RCTs propagated into meta-analyses and clinical guidelines, demonstrating that source-paper count alone understates downstream burden.
- Tang & Cai 2025: among 200,000 life-science systematic reviews, 299 incorporated at least one already-retracted paper-mill article into evidence synthesis (0.15%); 124/385 qualifying citations occurred after retraction. This is a detected-pathway contamination benchmark, not latent paper-mill prevalence.
- Scancar et al. 2026 demonstrates large-scale text screening feasibility but also why detector training on known/retracted cases cannot replace population-random adjudication.

# Current blockers / gates

## GATE B1 — real Pilot B feature frame — PASS

Completed real 2015–2020 seed frame:

- OpenAlex core article+review target denominator: **38,451,124**;
- population-random works: **600**;
- Retraction Watch enrichment works resolved into the target universe: **739**;
- unique selected works: **1,339**;
- exact inclusion probabilities/design weights retained;
- OpenAlex ID remains first-class because **229/600** population-random works lacked a DOI;
- no region/nationality/institution/language feature is used as a suspicion feature.

See `process/PILOT_B_SEED_RESULTS.md` and `data/pilot/pilot_b_seed_summary.json`.

## GATE B2 — calibrated adjudication — EVIDENCE LAYER MEASURED / EVIDENCE POLICY DECISION REQUIRED

Confirmatory random audit now supersedes the 600-work engineering random component for final prevalence estimation.

- target universe: OpenAlex core article+review, 2000–2025;
- live scaled denominator: **137,436,109** works;
- random audit: **10,000** works;
- six publication-period strata with explicit inclusion probabilities/design weights;
- **3,747 / 10,000** sampled works lack a DOI;
- dual blinded article adjudication: **20,000 assignments / 80 batches**.

Earlier Pilot A denominator was 137,445,874. The -9,765 difference (~-0.0071%) is retained as live-database snapshot drift.

See `process/SCALED_AUDIT_RESULTS.md` and `process/AI_ADJUDICATION_HANDOFF.md`.

### The packets cannot yet be executed, and it is not an idle AI surface

Measured 2026-09-19/20 on all 10,000 sampled works
(`process/EVIDENCE_CENSUS_AND_ALT_DATABASES.md`):

- the frozen batch schema carries **no title, abstract or full text**, and only
  retrieves OpenAlex venue labels plus a year;
- 6,242/10,000 works have an OpenAlex abstract, but only **4,410 (44.1%)** have
  one of ≥100 words, and **3,506 (35.1%)** have neither an abstract nor an OA PDF;
- free researcher-facing databases (Crossref, Europe PMC, Unpaywall, probed on all
  3,506) add a verified abstract for **408 works, 11.6% of the gap**: 393 of them
  among the DOI-bearing gap works (Europe PMC 384, Crossref 10) and 15 on verified
  title matches. The recovery is domain-tilted — 40.3% of the Health and 51.0% of
  the Life Sciences DOI gap, against 10.4% Physical and 5.1% Social;
- reading OpenAlex's full `locations` array instead of `best_oa_location` adds
  16 works, so the gap is not a field-selection artifact;
- the title-only route (1,879 works) is unusable: Crossref's fuzzy search returns
  a DOI for 99.8% of queries but only 3.1% of returned records match the title.

Consequence: `AI-ADJ-V1` cannot be run on the full 20,000 assignments without
either judging from metadata (prohibited by the prompt and by the
"do not infer fraud from country, language, institution or journal" rule) or
silently substituting a biomedical-weighted sample for a cross-domain probability
sample. An evidence policy must be recorded first — retrieve-then-abstain with a
stratified missingness table, a full-text pipeline, or a narrowed estimand.

AI may provide most labels, but its measurement error must be calibrated or sensitivity-tested. Dual-model agreement is not gold-standard truth.

Calibration-candidate infrastructure is now operational. Latest public-safe aggregate queue counts are stored in `data/pilot/ai_calibration_candidate_summary.json`; row-level candidates remain private/ephemeral. `CAL-REF-V1` supports independent REF_A/REF_B evidence review. Machine dual-consensus is explicitly reported as machine-assisted reference evidence, not a human gold standard.

## GATE C — latent prevalence identification — MODEL READY / LABELS PENDING

- [x] Weighted six-stratum latent prevalence model implemented.
- [x] AI sensitivity/specificity treated as uncertain measurement parameters.
- [x] Synthetic truth recovery passed.
- [x] Positive correlated-error sensitivity implemented for shared AI false positives/false negatives.
- [ ] Actual article AI labels not yet available.
- [ ] Anchor calibration and missingness sensitivity still required before a global hidden-case estimate.

No global hidden-case estimate is authorized until actual labels, calibration and sensitivity checks are complete.

## GATE D — semantic contamination — AI INPUTS COMPLETE / LABELS PENDING

The real high-propagation stress-test contains:

- 25 source papers;
- 7,443 observed incoming citation exposures;
- 1,753 post-retraction exposures;
- 486 sampled post-retraction edges;
- **972 dual-AI semantic assignments / 10 deterministic batches**;
- 200 edges with full-text signal and 290 with OA signal.

Raw citation exposure remains distinct from contamination. SCF and Dependence Ghost Half-Life require semantic labels and calibration. See `process/CITATION_AI_HANDOFF.md`.

## GATE F — RLY / cost scaling — FRAMEWORK READY / ATTRIBUTION PENDING

The fail-closed RLY component model and several direct time anchors exist, but a global empirical RLY total remains blocked until attributable affected-unit counts, hours-per-unit distributions, overlap resolution, and a defensible research-year conversion are calibrated. Whole associated grants are never called wasted funding.

## GATE G — Innovation Delay — ESTIMATOR READY / REAL MATCHED PANELS PENDING

Protocol, pre-shock candidate discovery, matched event-study estimation, pre-trend diagnostics and output-equivalent delay metrics are implemented. Real causal estimates require adjudicated source exposure plus frozen pre-treatment controls.

## GATE H — Sleeping Beauty — SB0/SB1 ENGINEERING PASS / SB2-SB3 PENDING

Historical B/awakening measurement and a leakage-safe landmark dataset are operational. No universal B cutoff is imposed. Integrity-related awakening suppression (SB2) and suppressed-opportunity counts (SB3) remain downstream of calibrated exposure and causal identification.

# Next execution queue

1. Execute the **80 article-adjudication batches** with independent AI_A and AI_B under `AI-ADJ-V1` (or continue any already-started external run without changing prompt/schema).
2. Run `collect_ai_batch_outputs.py --mode article` to verify all 20,000 returned assignments against the canonical manifest before any merge.
3. Merge A/B article outputs, route disagreements/LOW/INDETERMINATE cases to arbitration, and preserve abstentions.
4. Execute the **10 citation-edge batches** under `CIT-EDGE-V1`.
5. Run `collect_ai_batch_outputs.py --mode citation`, then semantic disagreement/arbitration.
6. Regenerate private calibration candidates via Pilot A as needed, create blinded REF_A/REF_B packets, execute `CAL-REF-V1`, merge only dual-consensus A/B anchors, then calibrate AI measurement error; report correlated-error, anchor-quality and missingness sensitivity.
7. Fit the weighted six-stratum global latent-prevalence model.
8. Convert calibrated semantic citation labels into SCF and **Dependence Ghost Half-Life**.
9. Run real Innovation Delay matched event studies using adjudicated E1-S sources and pre-shock controls.
10. Calibrate RLY attributable-time components; keep unsupported components scenario-only or NOT_IDENTIFIED.
11. Add temporally frozen semantic/network predictors to SB1, then test SB2 integrity exposure; keep SB3 suppressed-opportunity counts exploratory until causal gates pass.

# Do not do

- Do not multiply researcher self-report prevalence by global publication counts.
- Do not divide all Retraction Watch events by all OpenAlex works and call the result fraud prevalence.
- Do not add overlapping E1-S/E1-M/E1-P counts.
- Do not infer fraud from country, language, institution or journal.
- Do not treat text/image detector positives as guilt.
- Do not call every citation contamination.
- Do not publish Fermi scenario output as empirical finding.
- Do not claim a global count of never-awakened discoveries before the causal chain validates.
- Do not hand-concatenate AI batch outputs; run the manifest/checksum collector first.
- Do not add 14 h formatting time on top of a full idea-to-publication time estimate when that estimate already includes submission/revision labor.

# Handoff sentence

If this chat is lost, resume from this file plus `process/CHAT_HANDOFF_2026-09-19.md`. **Sampling, 90 AI input batches, batch-output integrity validation, latent prevalence inference, correlated-error sensitivity, calibration design/candidate/reference-review infrastructure, RLY framework, Innovation Delay scaffold, and SB0/SB1 delayed-recognition infrastructure are complete. The next prevalence-critical work is actual execution of article/citation AI batches and REF_A/REF_B evidence reviews, followed by collector validation, arbitration, calibration and the weighted latent model. Do not rebuild the 10,000-work sample, expose private candidate rows, hand-concatenate outputs, or estimate global prevalence/RLY/lost discoveries before their gates pass.**
